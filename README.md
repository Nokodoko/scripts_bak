scripts

These are a collection of scripts that I use on a daily basis. Please know that there are are dependencies, some of which I cannot publish because they would expose company secrets. I assume if you can find value in these, you will be able to fill in the blanks.


Intention:
There are several scripts in there that can fall under particular categories. Notable k8s and aws. While i know that i'm reinventing the wheel a little bit, I'm looking to package these scripts, according to subject area as helper scripts that I use on a daily basis.

I would like to reference this as the 1st phase of the project. Here I am prototyping all of my scripts in bash. Yes, its bash, love it or hate it
right now it offers me the development speed required to at least get a working POC prior to porting these over to Golang. This will be my first official go project.


Special Notes:
Arch Installer - This is a seperate project that I'm looking to package together to create my own distribution if you will. Yes, there is some 
polishing to my own system that still needs to be done, and I'll be picking up somemore with that effort.
